# Pearl-city
A networking based project done in cisco packet tracer
A city based network communication infrastructure subdivided into 6 network zones and each network zones or individual sites represented as an individual Router.


Appropriate network addresses were used and subnets were created to assign to each of the network zones so that the least amount of IP addresses was wasted.

Different security protocols and measurements were implemented along with static IP addressing to particular network zones.

Servers like DHCP,email,DNS and web servers were also configured manually along with configuring end devices to different zones
